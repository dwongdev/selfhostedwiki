Retype's file structure is very simple. For example, here is the part of the file structure of this very wiki.

```
/ _includes
    head.html
/ contributing
    adding-a-page.md
    file-structure.md
    getting-started.md
    modifying-a-page.md
/ guides
    / devops-toolchains
        gitlab-kubernetes.md
        index.yml
    / reverse-proxy-servers
        index.yml
        nginx.md
    / virtual-private-networks
        index.yml
        wireguard.md
    / webservers
        apache.md            
        index.yml
        nginx.md
    getting-a-free-domain-and-tls-certificates.md
    how-to-host-websites.md
    index.yml
/ learn
    common-terms-and-concepts.md
    difficulty-tiers.md
    index.yml
    operating-systems.md
    self-hosted-alternatives-to-popular-services-and-providers.md
    what-are-reverse-proxies.md
    what-is-self-hosting.md
/ static

retype.yml
    
```

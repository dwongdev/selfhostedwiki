Modifying a page is even simpler than creating one! As with [creating a page](/contributing/adding-a-page/) you can create a new branch in your forked repository. Open the document you wish to change in your favorite editor, make your changes and [submit a pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request)!

Retype uses Markdown to format and style text, amongst other things. If you want more information on how to use Markdown syntax in content, we recommend [this page](https://retype.com/guides/formatting/) and [this one](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/basics).
